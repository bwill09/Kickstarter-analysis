An Aalysis of Kickstarter campaigns 

Louise initiated a crowdfunding campaign to assist in funding her play fever.  She estimates a budget of more than 10,000 (USD), but she’s hesitant about taking her first step into the fund raising campaign. Therefore she resorted to a power excel user to sort and analyze crowdfunding data to determine whether there are specific elements that make up successful projects, and help her gain better insight into campaigns form start finish. 

Challenges faced during sorting and analyzing the crowdfunding data: “Successful US Kickstarter” and “Failed US Kickstarter” sheets  read error while computing, because after the filters, I select ‘move to a new sheet’. In essence, excel sees the entire dataset, even though they were filtered. Solution: I reached out to AskBCS Learning Assistant, we figured to manually copy the data from Kickstarter will allow excel to see and recognize dataset copied as values–that works! 

Two Outcome base on theater outcomes by lunch date:

•	The most successful Kickstarter campaign happened in May 

•	October, July, and June similarly has the same number of failed campaigns 

One conclusion made about outcome based on goals 

•	Goals amount between 45000 to 49999 has 0% canceled 

In Summary the initial dataset had limitation such as; unreadable Unix dates format, category and subcategory were in the same cell which would have prevented helpful analysis. I’ll recommend a table to show top backers_counts bases on specified ranges and chart reflecting countries with their total pledges.
